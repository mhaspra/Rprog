##Descriptive analysis
* Just describe the data
* E.g. census data or google Ngram Viewer

##Exploratory analysis
* Discovering new connections
* Is NOT predicting -> Correlation does not imply causation

##Inferential analysis
* Use a small sample to say something about a bigger population 
* Commonly the goal of statistical models

##Predictivve analysis
* Use data on some objects to predict values on another object
* If x predicts y it does not mean that x causes y
* Depends heavily on measuring the right variables
* E.g. predict that a customer is pregnant of what she buys

##Causal analysis
* Find out what habbens to one variable when you make another variable change
* Randomized studies
* E.g. Effects of drugs
